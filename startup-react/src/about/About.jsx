                Once upon a time there was a group of three friends named Cooper, Kelly, and Reed. They had an idea to
                create a
                shipping website that caters to clothing brands, and helps them sell their products. It just so happened
                that Cooper
                was about to take a web development class in college, and the rest is history.
