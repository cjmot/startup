        Once upon a time there was a group of three friends named Cooper, Kelly, and Reed. They had an idea to create a <br />
        shipping website that caters to clothing brands, and helps them sell their products. It just so happened that Cooper <br />
        was about to take a web development class in college, and the rest is history.
