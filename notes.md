**AWS Server**
- Not as hard to create as I imagined
- ssh keys stored as a file
- ssh -i production.pem ubuntu@shopkingsland.click

**Caddy** 
- Caddy is a web service that listens for incoming HTTP requests
- Caddy is used to serve application
- __Important Caddy files__:
  - Configuration file - Contains the definitions for routing HTTP requests that Caddy receives. This is used to determine the location where static HTML files are loaded from, and also to proxy requests into the services you will create later.
  - HTML file = This is the directory of files that Caddy serves up when requests are made to the root or your web server.

**Domain Name registration**
- https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/webServers/amazonWebServicesRoute53/amazonWebServicesRoute53.md
- route 53 in aws to create domain, once there, create 2 new records, one for the domain, one for subdomains.

**HTTPS**
- HTTP = non-secure hypertext transport protocol
- HTTPS = secure Hypertext Transport Protocol
  - just http but with negotiated secure connection that happens before data is exchanged.
  - Secure connection means all data is encrypted using __TLS protocol__.

**TLS**
- tls (aka SSL, less secure predecessor) works by negotiating a shared secret that is then used to encrypt data.
  - curl -v in device console shows actual negotiation, /dev/null redirection throws away actual http response
  - Core piece of tls handshake is exchange of web certificate that identifies the domain name of the server creating the secure connection
  - browser will compare the certificate domain name ot the one represented in the url and if they don't match, or the certificate is invalid or out of date, will display a massive warning.

**Web certificates**
- Generated by trusted 3rd party using public/private key encryption
- issuer responsible for verifying that certificate owner actually owns the domain name represented by certificate
- once there is certificate for your domain name, can serve certificate from your web server then the browser can validate certificate by using the public keys of the certificate issuer.
- used to cost hundreds of dollars a year to get web certificate, but small nonprofit called __Let's Encrypt__ started creating trusted web certificates for free.
  - Broke monopoly that trusted web certificate issuers had on industry
  - Now anyone who owns a domain name can dynamically generate and renew a certificate for free. 
  - __Let's Encrypt__ made the web safer and more reliable for everyone
  - Caddy uses Let's Encrypt to generate a web certificate every time an HTTPS request is made for a domain name that Caddy does not have a web certificate for.

**Enabling HTTPS**
- Modern browsers expect web servers to exclusively use HTTPS for all communication.
- next version of HTTP(v3) only supports secure connections. - you should always support HTTPS for any web application that you build.
- obtain and renew web certificates by enabling ACME protocol for you web server and communicating with Let's Encrypt to generate the needed certificates.

**More Caddy**
- Caddy has ACME support built into it by default, all you need to do is configure caddy with the domain name for your web server. 
- go into ubuntu, change file so the :80 and references to domain name are the domain name, then save (esc, then :wq), then restart caddy (sudo service caddy restart)
