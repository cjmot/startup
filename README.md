## EZ-DROP
### Description
Buying things online is at an all time high. In this world of people selling whatever they want wherever they 
want, and sellers buying reviews of their products to put more money in their pocket,
it is important to have a place where product reviews are genuine, and you can trust the opinions of others 
on what is being sold to you. That being said, EZ-DROP will be a place where you can do just that. 
EZ-DROP will allow you to connect with other people based on the reviews they wrote, and ask them
personally about the product. Not only that, but the products offered are listed based on reviews and 
wants, there are no sponsored products or paid reviews. Everything is genuine.
